Note:
- I have included a modification of the JSON file to the server to test the case where there are no any trucking companies listing. This file is called "notruckinglist.json". Thus, inputting this file name is valid within the website, with the exeption on showing an appropiate alert message. 

- This assignment has been tested on Chrome with the same output results.
